# Otium
Otium is a free and open source book manager and bookshelf organiser, that helps you managing your books and the ones you would like to read.

Built on top of SvelteKit, uses the Google Books API to retrieve informations and data. The database is hosted on Supabase.

## The project
The aim of the project is to create a UI friendly, lightweight and simple bookshelf organizer for people like me (who enjoy reading) to use.

The application is developed as a side project in my free time, and there are no deadlines except for the 31th of March (2022) for a stable product.
